This is a public BETA release of MAME.

No quality testing has been done. If this version doesn't work for you, just
use the previous one.

There are new features, fixed bugs, and new supported games. However, some
of the things which worked in the previous release version, might be broken.

VERY IMPORTANT:
At this moment in time, if you notice something obviously broken,
DO NOT E-MAIL THE DEVELOPERS ABOUT IT.
Use the public discussion forums for that purpose. They are regularly checked
by members of the team.
